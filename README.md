## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork this and create a new feature branch and make a pull request. Here's some cool thoughts I had for improvements...

    - use the Teamwork API to get email addresses (https://getuwiredinc.teamwork.com/people.json)    
    - ability to add name/email contacts in the app
    - ability to delete contacts in the app
    - maybe get Squirrel update thing going?
